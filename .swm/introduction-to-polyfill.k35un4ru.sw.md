title: Introduction to Polyfill
---
A polyfill is a piece of code that provides the technology that you, as a developer, expect the browser to provide natively. It's a fallback mechanism that enables applications to work in older browsers that do not support the latest features and APIs. In the DEMO-one-app, polyfills are used to ensure that the application works across different browsers with varying levels of support for modern JavaScript features. For instance, the `console.js` polyfill ensures that the console object is available for logging, while the `Intl.js` polyfill provides internationalization functionality.

## Console Polyfill

This polyfill is for the console object. It checks if the global console object exists, and if it doesn't, it creates one. Then it ensures that all the console methods like 'log', 'error', etc., are available. If any method is not available, it assigns a noop (no operation) function to it.

```javascript
if (!global.console) {
  global.console = {};
}

function noop() {}

// list of methods from
// https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console-api
[
  'assert',
  'clear',
  'count',
  'debug',
  'dir',
  'dirxml',
  'error',
  'group',
  'groupCollapsed',
  'groupEnd',
  'info',
  'log',
```

## Intl Polyfill

This polyfill is for the Intl object, which is used for internationalization. It imports a lean version of Intl and assigns it to the global Intl object if the native Intl is not available or not to be used.

```javascript
import Intl from 'lean-intl';

if (!(window && window.useNativeIntl)) {
  global.Intl = Intl;
  global.IntlPolyfill = Intl;
}
```

## ChildNode.remove Polyfill

This polyfill is for the remove method of ChildNode. It checks if the remove method is available in the Element prototype, and if it's not, it adds one. This method is used to remove a node from the DOM.

```javascript
if (!('remove' in Element.prototype)) {
  Element.prototype.remove = function remove() {
    if (this.parentNode) {
      this.remove();
    }
  };
}
```
