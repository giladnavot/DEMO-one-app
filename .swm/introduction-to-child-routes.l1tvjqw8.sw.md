title: Introduction to Child Routes
---
Child Routes in the DEMO-one-app are sub-routes or nested routes within a parent route. They are used to create a hierarchical structure of routes in the application. This structure allows for more organized and modular code, as well as more complex user interfaces.

The function `hasChildRoutes` is used to check if a module has child routes. It takes a module as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the module has child routes or not.
