title: DEMO-one-app overview
---
DEMO-one-app is a web application development framework that serves up a single page app built using React components. It uses a Node.js server and Holocron for code splitting. The framework is designed to facilitate the development of web applications by providing a robust and flexible structure. It also includes features for monitoring and performance analysis.

## Modules

### client

The client-side of the application is built using React and is responsible for setting up the global store, rendering the application, and handling user interactions. It also includes service workers for offline capabilities and performance improvements.

### server

The server in DEMO-one-app is responsible for serving the application to the client. It is built using Node.js and leverages the Holocron library for code splitting. The server is also responsible for handling HTTP and HTTPS requests, and it uses various middlewares for tasks such as pausing requests and handling JSON data. The server's functionality can be tested using Jest, and it can be configured using environment variables. The server is also involved in the application's performance monitoring, with metrics being collected and registered.

### universal

In the DEMO-one-app, 'universal' refers to the code that is not specific to any single part of the application, but is used throughout the entire application. This includes utility functions, configurations, and other shared resources. The 'universal' directory contains subdirectories for utilities, configurations (ducks), and test files (**tests**). The main entry point for the 'universal' code is the 'index.js' file, which exports the routes and reducers for use in other parts of the application.

### scripts

Scripts are sets of instructions written in a programming language that are executed by a script interpreter. In the context of the DEMO-one-app repository, scripts are written in JavaScript and are used to automate various tasks such as building the application, running tests, deploying the application, and more. These scripts are located in different directories such as `scripts`, `__performance__/scripts`, and `scripts/dangers`. They utilize Node.js built-in modules like `fs` for file system operations, `path` for handling file and directory paths, and `child_process` for spawning new processes. Some scripts also use third-party libraries like `yargs` for command-line argument parsing and `k6` for performance testing.
