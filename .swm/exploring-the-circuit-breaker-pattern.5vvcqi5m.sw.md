title: Exploring the Circuit Breaker Pattern
---
The Circuit Breaker in DEMO-one-app refers to a design pattern used in software development. It is a type of software pattern that aims to detect failures and encapsulates the logic of preventing a failure from constantly recurring, during maintenance, temporary external system failure or unexpected system difficulties.

In DEMO-one-app, the Circuit Breaker is used to monitor the status of the system and prevent failures from affecting the system's performance. It is implemented using the 'opossum' library, which provides a simple and robust framework for handling failures.

The Circuit Breaker pattern is used in the metrics system of the application. It is initialized with a 'noop' function, which does nothing and returns zero. This is done to ensure that the metrics system is always initialized, even if there are no metrics to report.

The 'registerCircuitBreaker' function is used to add a new Circuit Breaker to the metrics system. This allows the system to monitor the status of different parts of the application and prevent failures from affecting the overall performance.

# Circuit Breaker Initialization

Here, a `noopBreaker` instance of Circuit Breaker is created. This instance is then registered with the metrics system.

```javascript
const noop = () => 0;
const noopBreaker = new CircuitBreaker(noop);
const metrics = new PrometheusMetrics({ circuits: [noopBreaker], registry: register });
```

# Registering Circuit Breaker

This function `registerCircuitBreaker` is used to register a new Circuit Breaker instance with the metrics system.

```javascript
export const registerCircuitBreaker = (breaker) => {
  metrics.add([breaker]);
};
```

# Circuit Breaker Functions

This section covers the main functions related to the Circuit Breaker in the DEMO-one-app repository.

## noop

`noop` is a function that returns 0. It's used as a placeholder for the circuit breaker when no operation is performed.

```javascript
const noop = () => 0;
```

<SwmSnippet path="/src/server/metrics/circuit-breaker.js" line="25">

---

## noopBreaker

`noopBreaker` is a new instance of `CircuitBreaker` that uses the `noop` function. It's used to initialize the metrics with a circuit breaker.

```javascript
const noopBreaker = new CircuitBreaker(noop);
```

<SwmSnippet path="/src/server/metrics/circuit-breaker.js" line="26">

---

## metrics

`metrics` is an instance of `PrometheusMetrics` that takes an array of circuit breakers and a registry as parameters. It's used to report metrics related to the circuit breaker.

```javascript
const metrics = new PrometheusMetrics({ circuits: [noopBreaker], registry: register });
```

<SwmSnippet path="/src/server/metrics/circuit-breaker.js" line="28">

---

## registerCircuitBreaker

`registerCircuitBreaker` is a function that adds a new breaker to the `metrics`. It's used to track the metrics of the circuit breaker.

```javascript
export const registerCircuitBreaker = (breaker) => {
  metrics.add([breaker]);
};
```
