title: Getting Started with Server Utilities
---
Server Utilities in the DEMO-one-app are a collection of utility functions and modules that assist in the server-side operations of the application. They are located in the `src/server/utils/` directory. These utilities handle a variety of tasks, such as setting up DNS cache, loading modules, handling environment variables, and more. They are designed to enhance the efficiency and functionality of the server-side operations.

## Server Utility Categories

The server utilities can be broadly categorized into logging, validation, configuration, and data manipulation utilities. Each category has its own set of utility functions or configurations.
