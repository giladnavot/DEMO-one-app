title: Introduction to ChildNode

ChildNode in the DEMO-one-app repository refers to a JavaScript interface that contains methods that are particular to Node objects that can have a parent. The most commonly used method in this interface is the 'remove' method. This method is used to remove the object from the tree it belongs to.

## Usage of `remove` in the codebase

Here, a polyfill is created for the `remove` method. This is done to ensure compatibility with browsers that do not support the `remove` method natively.

```javascript
  Element.prototype.remove = function remove() {
    if (this.parentNode) {
      this.remove();
    }
  };
```

In this file, the `remove` method is used to remove style elements and a script element from the DOM. This is done to clean up the DOM after the initial render.

```javascript
    [...document.querySelectorAll('.ssr-css')]
      .forEach((style) => style.remove());

    delete global.__INITIAL_STATE__;
    document.querySelector('#initial-state').remove();
  } catch (error) {
```

Here, the `remove` method is used to remove script elements from the body of the document. This is done as part of the prerendering process.

```javascript
    bodyHelmetScripts.forEach((script) => script.remove());
    // If the helmet scripts exist in the head then we can assume that the body
```

In this file, the `remove` method is used to remove items from a cache. This is done when the result of a function call is undefined.

```javascript
        typeof result === 'undefined' && typeof error === 'undefined'
          ? cache.remove(hash(args))
          : cache.set(hash(args), error || result)
```
