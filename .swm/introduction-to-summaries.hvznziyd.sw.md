title: Introduction to Summaries
---
In the DEMO-one-app, 'Summaries' is an object that holds instances of the 'Summary' class from the 'prom-client' library. These instances are used to collect and record metrics data in the application.

The 'createSummary' function is used to create a new 'Summary' instance with the provided options and store it in the 'summaries' object. If a 'Summary' with the same name already exists, it will not create a new one.

The 'startSummaryTimer' function is used to start a timer for a specific 'Summary' instance. It throws an error if the 'Summary' instance does not exist in the 'summaries' object.

## Creating a Summary

The `createSummary` function is used to create a new Summary instance. It takes an options object as a parameter, which should include a unique name for the summary. If a summary with the same name already exists, the function will simply return, avoiding duplicate summaries.

```javascript
function createSummary(opts) {
  const { name } = opts;
  if (summaries[name]) {
    return;
  }
  summaries[name] = new Summary(opts);
}
```

## Starting a Summary Timer

The `startSummaryTimer` function is used to start the timer for a specific summary. It takes the name of the summary and additional arguments. If the summary with the provided name does not exist, it throws an error.

```javascript
function startSummaryTimer(name, ...args) {
  if (!summaries[name]) {
    throw new Error(`unable to find summary ${name}, please create it first`);
  }
  return summaries[name].startTimer(...args);
}
```

## Using Summaries in Other Modules

The `startSummaryTimer` function is exported and can be used in other modules. Here it is imported in the `index.js` file of the metrics module.

```javascript
  startSummaryTimer,
```
