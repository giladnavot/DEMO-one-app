title: Basic Concepts of Vendors
---
Vendors in the context of a software project typically refer to third-party libraries or services that the project depends on. These could be libraries used for testing, building, or enhancing the functionality of the project. They are usually managed through a package manager like npm and are defined in a package.json file. In the context of One App, vendors could include libraries like React for building the UI, Jest for testing, or Express for the server functionality.

# Using Vendors

This is where the project's dependencies, or 'vendors', are installed using npm. The '--no-optional' flag is used to skip optional dependencies.

# Testing with Vendors

Here, Jest and ESLint, which are vendor libraries, are used for running tests and linting the code respectively.
