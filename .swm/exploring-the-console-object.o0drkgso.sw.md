title: Exploring the Console Object
---
Console in this repository refers to a global object that provides access to the console of the host environment. It is used for logging and debugging purposes. The console object is polyfilled in the file `src/client/polyfill/console.js` to ensure its methods are available in all environments. This includes methods like 'log', 'debug', 'warn', and 'error'. A 'noop' function is used as a fallback for these methods if they are not available in the environment.

# Console Polyfill

This code checks if the global console object exists. If it doesn't, it creates an empty one. Then, it ensures that all the standard console methods exist. If any of them don't, it assigns them a `noop` function, which does nothing when called. This is done to prevent errors when calling console methods in environments where they might not be available.

```javascript
if (!global.console) {
  global.console = {};
}

function noop() {}

// list of methods from
// https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console-api
[
  'assert',
  'clear',
  'count',
  'debug',
  'dir',
  'dirxml',
  'error',
  'group',
  'groupCollapsed',
  'groupEnd',
  'info',
  'log',
```

# Noop Function

The `noop` function is a placeholder function that does nothing. It's used to fill in for console methods that might not be available in some environments.

```javascript
function noop() {}
```

## Console Polyfill

This code ensures that the console object is available in the global scope. If it's not, an empty object is assigned to `global.console`.

```javascript
if (!global.console) {
  global.console = {};
}
```

## Noop Function

The 'noop' function is a no-operation function. It does nothing and is used as a placeholder for console methods that may not be available in some environments.

```javascript
function noop() {}

```

## Console Methods

This code iterates over an array of console method names. If a method is not available on the console object, it is assigned the 'noop' function. This ensures that calling a console method will not result in an error, even if the method is not supported in the current environment.

```javascript
[
  'assert',
  'clear',
  'count',
  'debug',
  'dir',
  'dirxml',
  'error',
  'group',
  'groupCollapsed',
  'groupEnd',
  'info',
  'log',
  'profile',
  'profileEnd',
  'time',
  'timeEnd',
  'timeStamp',
  'trace',
  'warn',
]
```
