title: Availability of the Console Object in Different Environments
---
This document will cover the topic of when and why the console might not be available in certain environments. We'll cover:

1. The role of the console in the codebase
2. Situations where the console might not be available
3. The implications of the console's unavailability.

# The role of the console in the codebase

In the DEMO-one-app codebase, the console is primarily used for logging and debugging purposes. It is especially useful in the `initClient` function in `src/client/initClient.jsx`, where it is used to log any errors that occur during the initialization of the client.

# The role of the console in the codebase

Here, the console is used to log any errors that occur during the initialization of the client. This is crucial for debugging and understanding any issues that might arise during this process.

```javascript
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console -- error handling
    console.error(error);
    // TODO add renderError
  }
```

# Situations where the console might not be available

The console might not be available in certain environments due to a variety of reasons. For instance, in older browsers or certain JavaScript environments, the console object might not be defined. Additionally, in production environments, the console's functionality might be limited or disabled entirely to prevent the exposure of sensitive information.

# The implications of the console's unavailability

When the console is not available, error logging and debugging can become significantly more challenging. This is why the DEMO-one-app codebase includes a `noop` function in `src/client/polyfill/console.js`, which serves as a placeholder for console methods when the console is not available.

<SwmSnippet path="/src/client/polyfill/console.js" line="23">

# The implications of the console's unavailability

The `noop` function serves as a placeholder for console methods when the console is not available. This ensures that the application does not break due to the absence of the console.

```javascript
function noop() {}

// list of methods from
```
