title: Introduction to Web Application Development
---
Web Application Development refers to the process of creating applications that are accessed over a network such as the Internet or an intranet. It involves the use of various technologies and programming languages to build interactive and dynamic web applications. In the context of DEMO-one-app, it involves using a Node.js server and React components to build a single page application. The application is served up by One App, a web application development framework that also utilizes Holocron for code splitting.

## Using Redux in Web Application Development

This code snippet shows how Redux is used in the application. Redux is a popular library for managing application state in JavaScript applications. Here, a Redux middleware is being created with the `applyMiddleware` function. This middleware includes `redux-lifesaver`, which is used to limit the number of actions that can be dispatched in a given time frame, and any additional middleware passed in `extraMiddleware`. The middleware is then applied to the Redux store with the `compose` or `composeEnhancers` function, depending on the environment.

```javascript
import { applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux';
import lifesaver from 'redux-lifesaver';
import { MODULE_LOADED } from 'holocron/ducks/constants';

export default function createEnhancer(extraMiddleware = []) {
  const middleware = [
    ...extraMiddleware,
    lifesaver({
      dispatchLimit: 20,
      actionTypes: {
        [MODULE_LOADED]: { limitDuration: 0 },
      },
    }),
  ];

  let storeEnhancers;
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && global.BROWSER) {
    const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;
    storeEnhancers = composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(...middleware));
  } else {
    storeEnhancers = applyMiddleware(...middleware);
```
