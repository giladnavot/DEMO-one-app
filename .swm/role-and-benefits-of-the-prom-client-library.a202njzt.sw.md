---
This document will cover the interaction and benefits of the 'prom-client' library within the larger codebase. We'll cover:

1. What is the 'prom-client' library
2. How the 'prom-client' library is used in the codebase
3. The benefits of using the 'prom-client' library

# What is the 'prom-client' library

The 'prom-client' library is a popular Node.js client for Prometheus, a powerful open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. It provides a set of APIs and server to collect and expose metrics in the Prometheus format.

# How the 'prom-client' library is used in the codebase

In the 'ssrServer.js' file, we can see that 'prom-client' is assigned to the 'promClient' property. This suggests that the library is used for collecting and exposing metrics in the server-side rendering (SSR) server.

```javascript
    defaultMetrics: { enabled: false },
    endpoint: null,
    promClient: client,
  });
```

# The benefits of using the 'prom-client' library

The 'prom-client' library provides several benefits to the larger codebase. It allows for the collection of metrics from the application, which can be used for monitoring and alerting. This can help in identifying performance bottlenecks, understanding user behavior, and improving the overall quality of the application.
