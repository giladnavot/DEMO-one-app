title: Understanding Security Measures
---
Security in DEMO-one-app is implemented through various measures. One of these measures is the use of Content Security Policy (CSP), which is a security layer that helps detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. This is evident in the `csp.js` file where the 'Content-Security-Policy' header is set. Additionally, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is conditionally allowed as seen in the `conditionallyAllowCors.js` file, providing another layer of security by controlling which domains can access resources.
