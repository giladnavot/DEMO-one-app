# What is `hasChildRoutes`?

`hasChildRoutes` is a utility function that checks if a given module has child routes. It takes a module as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the module has child routes or not.

```javascript
const hasChildRoutes = (module) => module && !!module.childRoutes;
```

# How is `hasChildRoutes` used in the project?

`hasChildRoutes` is used in the project to determine if a module has child routes. This is useful in scenarios where the application needs to know if a module has any child routes for navigation or rendering purposes. For example, if a module has child routes, the application might render a nested navigation menu or handle routing differently.
